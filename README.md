# Century Bank
This app is a banking web app that allows users to create a profile and from there manage bank accounts. Users can create new loan accounts, oay them off and transfer money between their main accounts. User's accounts can be found on the Accounts page of the dashboard. If the user has more than 3 loan accounts pagination is invoked. and the search bar can be used to isolate specific accounts by name. 

## Overview
This was a massive learning experience as it was my first project that I completed on my own and not alongside a course. It really helped get a full understanding of react state and context as well as exactly how async function work. This was also a big learning experience for web design and styling of elements. The biggest challenge I have always had when building small web projects was the stying aspect. In this project I was able to practice styling with css and fully understand the different CSS properties and implement small features like a sidebar and a search bar.

## Technologies
This was my first project done completely on my own after learning web development from The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu and MERN Stack Course 2022 by John Smilga.
